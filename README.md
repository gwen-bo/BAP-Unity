# Geraakt: an interactive installation for Memento Woordfestival

A festival where word art in all it forms is being celebrated. For this installation we started from the concept of 'word art touches/can touch'. 
We invite people to interact with the authors and their words and to be touched/ touch. 

This interactive installation is built using a Kinect V2 and Unity - built on the notion of interactive fabrics. 
Via rear-projection, hands are being displayed on a cloth. The visitor places/presses their hands into the displayed hand(s). 
This change of depth triggers a certain 'author', then the auditive word art is being played while the visuals change.
